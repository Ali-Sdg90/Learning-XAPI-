# Learning-XAPI

This repository contains my research and work on learning Storyline 360, SCORM, Learn LRS, and integrating xAPI with Storyline 360.

## Repository Structure

### Connect Storyline to LRS with xAPI
This folder includes files for connecting Storyline 360 to LRS via xAPI. The designed courses can send data to a middleware (LRS) and store extensive custom data.

- **Storyline-files**: Contains Storyline 360 files for two courses. One course sends data to the LRS, and the other retrieves data from the LRS to create custom learning paths.
- **Web-files**: Contains web output files for the two courses, viewable in a web browser.

### Learning Storyline 360
This folder documents my learning path for Storyline 360, showcasing its capabilities. It contains large, complex Storyline files with immersive and custom paths that adapt based on user choices.
